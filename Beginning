# The Commons 

 

> An open-source, federated social platform designed for human flourishing, not corporate profit. We prioritize genuine egalitarianism, collective ownership, and transparent algorithms. Build meaningful connections through multiple communication modes in communities you help govern.

## 🌱 Project Status 

 

**We’re in the foundation phase.** This repository currently contains our vision, principles, and architectural plans. We’re actively seeking contributors to help build the first proof of concept. 

 

**Not looking for users yet** - we’re looking for **co-creators**. 

 

----- 

 

## Why The Commons? 

 

Social media promised connection but delivered division, distraction, and extraction. Current platforms optimize for engagement at any cost, treat users as products, and concentrate power in corporate hands. 

 

We’re building an alternative that puts **human wellbeing first**: 

 

- 🤝 **Genuine egalitarianism** - No algorithmic favoritism or pay-to-play prominence 

- 🏛️ **Collective ownership** - Contributors have actual governance power 

- 🧠 **Human-centric design** - Reduces anxiety, encourages reflection 

- 🌐 **Federated architecture** - No single point of control or failure 

- 🔍 **Transparent technology** - Open-source algorithms you can understand 

- 💬 **Multiple modes** - Different conversations need different shapes 

- 📊 **Meaningful metrics** - We measure flourishing, not engagement 

 

----- 

 

## Core Principles 

 

1. **Egalitarian by Design** - Every voice has equal standing 

1. **Collectively Owned** - Those who contribute have real power 

1. **Human Wellbeing First** - Technology serves people, not profit 

1. **Transparent & Open** - No black boxes or hidden algorithms 

1. **Federated & Resilient** - Distributed control and governance 

1. **Context-Aware** - Tools that fit how humans actually communicate 

1. **Sustainable Pace** - Built for long-term participation, not addiction 

1. **Learning & Growth** - Mistakes and changed minds are celebrated 

1. **Value Diversity** - Recognition beyond likes and follows 

1. **Joy & Wonder** - Amplify what makes us human

## What We’re Building 

 

### A Protocol, Not Just a Platform 

 

Like email or the web, The Commons is a **federated protocol** that anyone can implement: 

 

- **You own your identity and data** - portable across instances 

- **Communities self-govern** - different rules, shared values 

- **Multiple clients possible** - choose your interface 

- **No vendor lock-in** - move freely between servers 

 

### Multiple Modes of Connection 

 

- **Ephemeral spaces** - Casual, low-stakes conversation 

- **Threaded discussions** - Working through ideas together 

- **Collaborative canvases** - Collective problem-solving 

- **Deep archives** - Building lasting knowledge 

- **Slow correspondence** - Thoughtful, asynchronous exchange 

 

### Built for Transformation 

 

We optimize for: 

 

- ✨ Changed minds through good-faith dialogue 

- 🤝 Real-world collaboration emerging from online connection 

- 🌱 Skills learned and problems solved together 

- ⚖️ Conflicts resolved constructively 

- 🎯 Communities that self-govern effectively

## Frequently Asked Questions 

 

### Is this just another Mastodon? 

 

We’re inspired by federated platforms like Mastodon, but we’re exploring different design patterns - particularly around collaborative spaces, transparent algorithms, and governance models. Think of it as learning from what works and innovating where gaps exist. 

 

### When can I use it? 

 

We’re in the foundation phase. There’s no working software yet - just vision and planning. If you want to help **build** it, join now. If you want to **use** it, check back in several months. 

 

### How will this be funded? 

 

We’re exploring sustainable models that don’t compromise our principles: member cooperatives, grants, ethical sponsorships, and community support. We will **never** use surveillance advertising or extractive data practices. 

 

### Who’s “we”? 

 

Right now, a small group with a vision. Soon, we hope, **you**. This is genuinely collaborative - no hidden company, no secret investors. Just people who believe we can do better. 

 

### Can this really compete with Big Tech? 

 

We’re not trying to “beat” Facebook or Twitter at their own game. We’re building something fundamentally different for people who want an alternative. Success means creating spaces where human flourishing matters more than market share.
