# The-Commons
An open-source, federated social platform designed for human flourishing, not corporate profit. We prioritize genuine egalitarianism, collective ownership, and transparent algorithms. Build meaningful connections through multiple communication modes in communities you help govern. No engagement metrics, no extraction—just human connection.
