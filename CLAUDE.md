# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for The Commons

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20
**Repository:** The Commons - A Federated Social Platform for Human Flourishing
**Current Phase:** Foundation (Phase 1) - Documentation & Planning

---

## Project Overview

**The Commons** is an early-stage, open-source project building a federated social platform designed for human wellbeing rather than corporate profit. This is a **documentation-only repository** currently - there is no implementation code yet.

### Core Mission
Build a social platform that prioritizes:
- Genuine egalitarianism (equal standing for all voices)
- Collective ownership (contributors have real governance power)
- Human-centric design (reduces anxiety, encourages reflection)
- Federated architecture (distributed control)
- Transparent algorithms (open-source, explainable)
- Multiple communication modes (different conversations need different shapes)
- Human flourishing metrics (not engagement or growth)

### Current Status
- **Phase:** Foundation (1 of 4)
- **Content:** Vision documents, manifesto, and planning
- **Code:** None yet - purely conceptual/planning stage
- **Community:** Seeking co-creators, not users
- **License:** MIT for code, Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 for documentation

## Project Principles & Conventions

### The 10 Core Principles (Design Constraints)

Every decision must be evaluated against these:

1. **Genuine Egalitarianism** - Equal standing for all, no algorithmic favoritism
2. **Collective Ownership** - Contributors have actual governance power
3. **Human-Centric Design** - Optimize for wellbeing, not engagement
4. **Technological Transparency** - Open-source, explainable algorithms
5. **Contextual Communication** - Different tools for different conversations
6. **Federated & Resilient** - No single point of control or failure
7. **Value Diversity** - Multiple forms of appreciation beyond likes
8. **Sustainable Pace** - Long-term participation, not addiction
9. **Learning & Growth** - Mistakes and changed minds celebrated
10. **Joy & Wonder** - Amplify what makes us human

### Success Metrics (The Commons Manifesto:372-397)

The project measures success by:
- People feeling more connected and less anxious
- Conflicts resolved constructively
- Users learning skills and changing minds through dialogue
- Real-world collaboration emerging from online connection
- Effective community self-governance
- Contributors feeling genuine ownership
- People choosing to be here (not trapped/addicted)

**NOT measured by:** Engagement, growth, market share, or virality

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: Foundation

**Completed:**
- ✅ Manifesto and core principles
- ✅ Initial repository setup
- ✅ Basic documentation

**In Progress / Next Steps:**
- ⬜ Technical architecture documentation
- ⬜ Governance model
- ⬜ Community formation
- ⬜ Contributor onboarding materials
- ⬜ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ⬜ CONTRIBUTING.md
- ⬜ ARCHITECTURE.md
- ⬜ GOVERNANCE.md
- ⬜ ROADMAP.md (detailed)

### Git Practices

**Branch Strategy:**
- Working on feature branches (e.g., `claude/add-claude-documentation-0PllS`)
- Branch naming: `claude/<description>-<session-id>`
- Clean commit history preferred

**Commit Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Focus on "why" rather than just "what"
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- No secrets in commits (.env, credentials, etc.)

**Current Branch:** `claude/add-claude-documentation-0PllS`

## Contributing to The Commons

### Who's Needed

The project explicitly welcomes diverse contributors:

- **Developers** - Infrastructure (Rust, TypeScript, protocol design mentioned)
- **Designers** - Humane interfaces and experiences
- **Writers** - Documentation, communication, community building
- **Researchers** - Study what works, iterate on design
- **Critics** - Poke holes, strengthen thinking, challenge assumptions
- **Community Builders** - Shape culture, resolve conflicts, build bridges

**New to open source?** The project emphasizes being a learning community.

### Contribution Philosophy

Based on The Commons Manifesto:291-295:
- Build openly and collaboratively
- Document design decisions (make them debatable)
- Optimize architecture for understanding and forking
- Regular public feedback cycles
- Technical excellence AND community care equally valued

### What to Work On

**High Priority (Foundation Phase):**
1. **Documentation** - Fill gaps in missing docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, etc.)
2. **Architecture Planning** - Technical design for federated protocol
3. **Governance Design** - How will decisions be made?
4. **Community Tools** - Discussion forums, contributor onboarding

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Proof of Concept (minimal viable implementation)
- Phase 3: Protocol Development (federation spec, reference implementation)
- Phase 4: Ecosystem Growth (multiple servers, alternative clients)

## Important Context for AI Assistants

### What This Project Is
- A vision and planning document for a federated social platform
- An attempt to build something fundamentally different from Big Tech
- A collaborative, community-owned effort
- In very early stages (no code exists yet)
- Serious about egalitarianism and human flourishing

### What This Project Is NOT
- Not "just another Mastodon" (inspired by, but different)
- Not a company or startup (no hidden investors)
- Not trying to "beat" Big Tech at their game
- Not ready for users (seeking builders first)
- Not funded yet (exploring cooperative/grant models)

### Key Differentiators
- **Multiple communication modes** - Not forcing all conversations into one shape
- **Transparent algorithms** - Users understand and can modify what they see
- **Collective governance** - Contributors have real decision-making power
- **Human flourishing metrics** - Measuring wellbeing, not engagement
- **Design constraints as principles** - The 10 principles are non-negotiable

### Tone and Communication

When working on this project:
- Be serious about the mission but not somber
- Welcome newcomers warmly (learning community)
- Acknowledge uncertainty (early stage = many unknowns)
- Value questions as much as answers

- Focus on long-term sustainability, not quick wins

### Red Flags to Avoid

Based on the manifesto, avoid suggesting:
- Engagement-optimizing features
- Algorithmic favoritism or verification systems
- Surveillance or data extraction practices
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- Addictive design patterns
- Closed/proprietary approaches
- Single points of control or failure
- Metrics focused on growth/virality

### Green Lights to Pursue

- Features that reduce anxiety
- Tools for constructive conflict resolution
- Multiple modes of communication
- Transparent, explainable systems
- Community governance mechanisms
- Collaborative creation tools
- Celebration of changed minds

## FAQ for AI Assistants

**Q: Can I write code for this project?**
A: Not yet - the project is in documentation/planning phase. Focus on architecture planning, documentation, and design specs first.

**Q: Should I suggest growth/engagement strategies?**
A: No. The project explicitly rejects engagement optimization. Focus on human wellbeing metrics instead.

**Q: Can I add "nice to have" features?**
A: Keep it minimal. Every feature must serve the core mission and pass the 10-principle test. Avoid over-engineering.

**Q: Should I create conventional social media features (likes, follows, etc.)?**
A: Question them first. The project wants to rethink these patterns. Consider: Does this serve human flourishing or just habit?

**Q: What if I'm unsure if something aligns with principles?**
A: Ask! Reference the specific principle and explain the uncertainty. The community values good questions.

**Q: How detailed should documentation be?**
A: Very. The project values transparency and wants architecture "optimized for understanding and forking."

**Q: Should I assume technical expertise from contributors?**
A: No. The project welcomes newcomers and emphasizes being a learning community.

**Q: Can I suggest corporate/VC funding?**
A: No. The project explores member cooperatives, grants, ethical sponsorships - never surveillance advertising or extractive practices.
